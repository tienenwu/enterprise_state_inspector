- Ensure `flutter pub get` succeeds after dependency changes.
- Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` from the package root; resolve issues before handing off.
- If UI/behavior changes, rebuild or smoke-test the `example/` app (`cd example && flutter run`).
- Update README/CHANGELOG/version when shipping user-facing features; keep MIT license header accurate.
